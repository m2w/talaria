# What?

_talaria_ is a commenting system for static content, such as github pages. Instead of github issues, it is based on commit comments.

The name _talaria_ comes from the [winged sandals](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Talaria) worn by Hermes in Greek mythology.

# Why?

Because I personally find the approach using github issues less than ideal. 
Commit comments have the advantage of being directly "attached" to the relevant file.

# How?

See [m2w.github.com/talaria/](http://m2w.github.com/talaria/) for getting started instructions.

# TODOs

- [ ] review performance and caching
- [ ] code cleanup
- [ ] gracefull error handling (e.g. when exceeding the `X-RateLimit-Limit`)
